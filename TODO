- Create test for codecs (input_codec and output_codec):
  * Headers should be included in conversions
  * Encode at Table.to_csv
  * Encode at Table.to_text_file
  * Encode at Table.__str__
- Create a command-line tool (called outputty) so some users don't need to
  create a Python script to use the software (from CSV/stdin to stdout/CSV/TXT)
- Add doc strings to outputty module, Table class and all Table methods
- Create __unicode__?
- Create some way to print colors and backgrounds
- The number of input headers should not be the same of output ones
- Receive a function to 'process row and return' instead of returning raw-data
