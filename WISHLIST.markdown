Wish List
=========

This list is not a promise. :-) We need to think about each proposed feature
and how it'll be be implemented to have the better user experience using the
library. Just a brainstorm. The ideas are divided in the categories below:


CLI
---

- __[really-needed]__ Create a command-line tool (called `outputty`) so some
  users don't need to create a Python script to use the software. This
  command-line interface should be able to get data from stdin or CSV and
  export data to stdout, CSV or TXT. __It won't be interactive__.


API
---

- __[really-needed]__ Add doc strings to `outputty` module, `Table` class and
  all `Table`'s methods.
- Create some way to print colors and backgrounds. See the article [ANSI escape
  code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) on Wikipedia.
- Create `Table.__repr__`?
  - If yes, accept creating an object with representation generated by
    `__repr__`.


Packaging
---------

- Modify the file structure (or create a script to do it) so we can create a
  Python package. See
  [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Packaging](http://guide.python-distribute.org/).
- Register the project on [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).


Processing Input Data
---------------------

- The number of input headers should not be the same of output ones.
- Receive a function to 'process row and return' instead of returning raw-data.
- Add `ordering='ascending|descending'` parameter to `Table`.
- Add `order_by='<header_name>'` parameter to `Table`.


Data Exchange Formats
---------------------

- `from_mysql='username:password@host/database/table'`?
- `Table.to_html`?
- `Table.to_latex`?


Table Templates
---------------

- Add support to `\r\n` or any other line feed instead of only `\n`.
- Should be able to change the space character (like `pipe`, `plus` etc.).
- Change the name of special characters (`pipe`, `plus` and `dash`) to
  something more intuitive.
- Create some kind of 'templates' with pre-defined `pipe`, `plus`, `dash` etc.
  See [sqlite's .mode column](http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html).
- The `dash` inside the line that split the table into header and data should
  be different from the "normal `dash`". All these "characters" should be
  generalised.
