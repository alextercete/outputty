Wish List
=========

This list is not a promise. :-) We need to think about each proposed feature
and how it'll be be implemented to have the better user experience using the
library. Just a brainstorm. The ideas are divided in the categories below:


Features
--------

- __[really-needed]__ Create a command-line tool (called `outputty`) so some
  users don't need to create a Python script to use the software. This
  command-line interface should be able to get data from stdin or any "read"
  plugin available and export data to stdout (CSV or TXT) or using any "write"
  plugin available. __It won't be interactive__ and it __must have a man
  page__. The development is in process at branch `feature/cli`.


API
---

- __[really-needed]__ Add doc strings to `Table` and its methods and all
  plugins.
- Create `Table.__repr__`?
  - If yes, accept creating an object with representation generated by
    `__repr__`.
- Create `Table.map`?
- What to do with column names received by methods/plugins that are not
  unicode? Always convert it (so `self.headers` will be always unicode)?
- Accept any sequence/iterable/map on append instead of only `list`, `tuple`
  and `dict`?
- Create some way to filter input columns in all plugins.
- Create some way to filter output columns in all plugins.
- Encode and decode strings with the default system encoding instead of
  __UTF-8__ (?)


Documentation
-------------

- Create a better documentation than `README.markdown` (maybe using something
  like `create-readme.py` + sphinxdoc)
- Add some "use cases" in `README.markdown`
- Create documentation about concept of plugins (for developers)


Packaging-related stuff
-----------------------

- __[really-needed]__ Modify the file structure (or create a script to do it)
  so we can create a Python package. See
  [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Packaging](http://guide.python-distribute.org/).
- __[really-needed]__ Register the project on
  [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi). See
  [this guide](http://guide.python-distribute.org/quickstart.html).
- Get a better grade on [PyPants](http://pypants.org/projects/outputty/).


Plugins
-------

- __mysql__.read/write: work started at branch `feature/mysql`
- __html__.read (write is done)
- __dbf__.read/write. See [dbf](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbf/0.90.0),
  [dbfpy](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbfpy/2.2.5) and [this code
  snippet](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/362715/)
- __xls__.read/write. See [xlrd](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) and
  [xlwt](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt)
- __LaTeX__.write (?)
- __text__: Create some way to print colors and backgrounds (links:
      [ANSI escape code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) and
      library [fabulous](http://lobstertech.com/fabulous.html)). Create
      `plugin_text.read`?


### Templates

- Plugin `text`:
    - Should be able to change the space character and line feed (like `pipe`,
      `plus` etc.).
    - Change the name of special characters (`pipe`, `plus` and `dash`) to
      something more intuitive.
    - Create some kind of 'templates' with pre-defined `pipe`, `plus`, `dash`
      etc. See [sqlite's .mode column](http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html).
    - The `dash` inside the line that split the table into header and data
      should be different from the "normal `dash`". All these "characters"
      should be generalised.
- Plugin `csv`:
    - Create some way to change CSV dialect.
